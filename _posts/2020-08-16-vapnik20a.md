title: 'Complete statistical theory of learning: learning using statistical invariants'
abstract: 'Statistical theory of learning considers methods of constructing approximations
  that converge to the desired function with increasing number of observations. This
  theory studies mechanisms that provide convergence in the space of functions in
  $L_2$ norm, i.e., it studies the so-called strong mode of convergence. However,
  in Hilbert space, along with the convergence in the space of functions, there also
  exists the so-called weak mode of convergence, i.e., convergence in the space of
  functionals. Under some conditions, this weak mode of convergence also implies the
  convergence of approximations to the desired function in  $L_2$ norm, although such
  convergence is based on other mechanisms. The paper discusses new learning methods
  which use both modes of convergence (weak and strong) simultaneously. Such methods
  allow one to execute the following: (1) select an admissible subset of functions
  (i.e., the set of appropriate approximation functions), and (2)  find the desired
  approximation in this admissible subset. Since only two modes of convergence exist
  in Hilbert space, we call the theory that uses both modes the complete statistical
  theory of learning. Along with general reasoning, we describe new learning algorithms
  referred to as Learning Using Statistical Invariants (LUSI). LUSI algorithms were
  developed for sets of functions belonging to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS);
  they include the modified SVM method (LUSI-SVM method). Also, the paper presents
  a LUSI modification of Neural Networks (LUSI-NN). LUSI methods require fewer training
  examples that standard approaches for achieving the same performance. In conclusion,
  the paper discusses the general (philosophical) framework of a new learn- ing paradigm
  that includes the concept of intelligence.'
