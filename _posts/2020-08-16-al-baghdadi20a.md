title: Practical investment with the long-short game
abstract: In this paper we apply the aggregating algorithm, an on-line prediction
  with expert advice algorithm, to real-world foreign exchange trading data with the
  aim of finding investment strategies with optimal returns. We consider the Long-Short
  game first introduced in Vovk and Watkins (1998) and itâ€™s implementation, including
  the derivation of expert predictions from model trading data. Furthermore, we propose
  modifications to improve the practical performance of the game with respect to well-known
  portfolio performance indicators.
