title: Batch mode active learning for mitotic phenotypes using conformal prediction
abstract: Machine learning models are now ubiquitous in all areas of data analysis.
  As the amount of data generated continues to increase exponentially, the task of
  annotating sufficient objects with known labels by an expert remains expensive.
  To mitigate this, active learning approaches attempt to identify those objects whose
  labels will be most informative. Here, we introduce a batch-based active learning
  framework in a pooled setting based around conformal predictors. We select objects
  to add to the labelled observations based on perceived novelty, while mitigating
  the risks of selecting highly correlated or outlying observations. We compare our
  approach to classical methods using an example UCI dataset, and demonstrate its
  application to a pharmaceutically relevant cellular imaging problem for classifying
  mitotic phenotypes. Our approach facilitates efficient discovery of rare and novel
  classes within large screening datasets.
