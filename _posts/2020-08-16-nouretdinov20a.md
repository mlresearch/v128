title: Conformal anomaly detection for visual reconstruction using gestalt principles
abstract: 'In this paper, we combine a modern machine learning technique called conformal
  predictors (CP) with elements of gestalt detection and apply them to the problem
  of visual perception in digital images. Our main task is to quantify several gestalt
  principles of visual reconstruction. We interpret an image/shape as being perceivable
  (meaningful) if it sufficiently deviates from randomness - in other words, the image
  could hardly happen by chance. These deviations from randomness are measured by
  using conformal prediction technique that can guarantee the validity under certain
  assumptions. The technique describes the detection of perceivable images that allows
  to bound the number of false alarms, i.e. the proportion of non-perceivable images
  wrongly detected as perceivable. '
