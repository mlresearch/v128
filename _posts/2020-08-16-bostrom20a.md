title: Mondrian conformal regressors
abstract: Standard (non-normalized) conformal regressors produce intervals that are
  of identical size and hence non-informative in the sense that they provide no information
  about the uncertainty at the instance level. A common approach to handle this limitation
  is to normalize the produced interval using a difficulty estimate, which results
  in larger intervals for instances judged to be more difficult and smaller intervals
  for instances judged to be easier. A problem with this approach is identified; when
  the difficulty estimation function provides little or no information about the true
  error at the instance level, one would expect the predicted intervals to be more
  similar in size compared to when using a more accurate difficulty estimation function.
  However, experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the opposite.
  Moreover, the intervals produced by normalized conformal regressors may be several
  times larger than the largest previously observed prediction error, which clearly
  is counter-intuitive. To alleviate these problems, we propose Mondrian conformal
  regressors, which partition the calibration instances into a number of categories,
  before generating one prediction interval for each category, using a standard conformal
  regressor. Here, binning of the difficulty estimates is employed for the categorization.
  In contrast to normalized conformal regressors, Mondrian conformal regressors can
  never produce intervals that are larger than twice the largest observed error. The
  experiments verify that the resulting regressors are valid and as efficient as when
  using normalization, while being significantly more efficient than the standard
  variant. Most importantly, the experiments show that Mondrian conformal regressors,
  in contrast to normalized conformal regressors, have the desired property that the
  variance of the size of the predicted intervals correlates positively with the accuracy
  of the function that is used to estimate difficulty.
