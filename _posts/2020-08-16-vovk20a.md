title: Conformal calibrators
abstract: Most existing examples of full conformal predictive systems, split conformal
  predictive systems, and cross-conformal predictive systems impose severe restrictions
  on the adaptation of predictive distributions to the test object at hand. In this
  paper we develop split conformal predictive systems that are fully adaptive. Our
  method consists in calibrating existing predictive systems; the input predictive
  system is not supposed to satisfy any properties of validity, whereas the output
  predictive system is guaranteed to be calibrated in probability.
