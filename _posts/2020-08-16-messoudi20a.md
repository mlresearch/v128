title: Conformal multi-target regression using neural networks
abstract: Multi-task learning is a domain that is still not fully studied in the conformal
  prediction framework, and this is particularly true for multi-target regression.
  Our work uses inductive conformal prediction along with deep neural networks to
  handle multi-target regression by exploring multiple extensions of existing single-target
  non-conformity measures and proposing new ones. This paper presents our approaches
  to work with conformal prediction in the multiple regression setting, as well as
  the results of our conducted experiments.
