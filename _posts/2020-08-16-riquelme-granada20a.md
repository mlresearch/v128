title: Fast probabilistic prediction for kernel SVM via enclosing balls
abstract: 'Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful paradigm that has proven to
  be extremely useful for the task of classifying high-dimensional objects. It does
  not only perform well in learning linear classifiers, but also shows outstanding
  performance in capturing non-linearity through the use of kernels. In principle,
  SVM allows us to train “scoring” classifiers i.e. classifiers that output a prediction
  score. However, it can also be adapted to produce probability-type outputs through
  the use of the Venn-Abers framework. This allows us to obtain valuable information
  on the labels distribution for each test object. This procedure, however, is restricted
  to very small data given its inherent computational complexity. We circumvent this
  limitation by borrowing results from the field of computational geometry. Specifically,
  we make use of the concept of a coreset: a small summary of data that is constructed
  by discretising the input space into enclosing balls, so that each ball will be
  represented by only one object. Our results indicate that training Venn-Abers predictors
  using enclosing balls provides an average acceleration of 8 times compared to the
  regular Venn-Abers approach while largely retaining probability calibration. These
  promising results imply that we can still enjoy well-calibrated probabilistic outputs
  for kernel SVM even in the realm of large-scale datasets.'
