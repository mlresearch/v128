title: Mixing past predictions
abstract: In the framework of the theory of prediction with expert advice, we present
  an algorithm for online aggregation of the functional predictions. The approach
  implies that at each time step some algorithm issues a forecast in the form of a
  function and then the master algorithm combines these current and past functional
  forecasts into one aggregated functional forecast. We apply the proposed algorithm
  for the problem of long-term predictions of time series. By combining the past and
  current long-term functional forecasts, we obtain a smoothing mechanism that protects
  our algorithm from temporary changes in the trend of time series, noise and outliers.
  To evaluate the performance of presented aggregating algorithm as a long-term forecaster
  we use a new “integral” loss function and the delayed feedback approach. We apply
  this algorithm for the regression problems, we present some method for smoothing
  regression forecasts.
