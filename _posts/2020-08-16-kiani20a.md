title: A conformalized density-based clustering analysis of malicious traffic for
  botnet detection
abstract: 'In this work, we present a clustering technique within the conformal prediction
  framework and describe its application to bot-generated network traffic in order
  to build botnet behavioral models, with a view to improving the detection of compromised
  hosts. The technique has a natural connection to density-based clustering. Once
  a required significance level has been set, this technique can discover the clusters
  and the noise in the data. To obtain a clustering of the underlying distribution,
  we use conformal prediction in combination with a density estimator which is used
  for point prediction, to identify a few so-called focal points that are indeed the
  centers of possibly overlapping spheres or ellipsoids, that represent the clusters.
  There are several advantages to the developed technique: the number of clusters
  is determined automatically. Furthermore, the technique is able to find nonlinearly
  separable clusters. Moreover, a new conformity measure related to BotFinder, an
  algorithm for finding bots in network traffic, is developed that can be used as
  a method for point prediction. We performed an experimental evaluation of the proposed
  approach in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The results suggest that the approach
  obtains relatively high accuracies and is more effective when compared with previous
  conformal clustering techniques.'
