title: Training conformal predictors
abstract: Efficiency criteria for conformal prediction, such as observed fuzziness
  (i.e., the sum of p-values associated with false labels), are commonly used to evaluate
  the performance of given conformal predictors. Here, we investigate whether it is
  possible to exploit efficiency criteria to learn classifiers, both conformal predictors
  and point classifiers, by using such criteria as training objective functions. The
  proposed idea is implemented for the problem of binary classification of hand-written
  digits. By choosing a 1-dimensional model class (with one real-valued free parameter),
  we can solve the optimization problems through an (approximate) exhaustive search
  over (a discrete version of) the parameter space. Our empirical results suggest
  that conformal predictors trained by minimizing their observed fuzziness perform
  better than conformal predictors trained in the traditional way by minimizing the
  prediction error of the corresponding point classifier. They also have reasonable
  performance in terms of their prediction error on the test set.
