title: Classication of aerosol particles using inductive conformal prediction
abstract: Aerosol particles are small airborne particles suspended in air affecting
  the climate and human health. Different types of particles come from different sources
  and impact the environment in different ways, which is why a reliable particle classification
  is of interest. In this study, inductive conformal prediction is applied to a dataset
  of laboratory-generated aerosol particles, consisting of ten particle subclasses
  that can be grouped into four parent classes for classification. The performance
  of the inductive conformal predictor (ICP) is evaluated on particle subclasses that
  were not included in training or calibration. The ICP appears to give accurate predictions
  in some cases, namely if the unknown particle is similar to the known ones in the
  parent class. The precision of the underlying model is not high enough to reject
  all unknown particles for any subclass at the chosen significance levels, but the
  ICP manages to reject them at a higher rate if they are sufficiently different from
  the training and calibration samples. Overall, the performance is not straightforward
  to evaluate and it seems to depend on the heterogeneity and size of the classes
  of particles. Further investigations using a simpler data and model set-up would
  be beneficial, and data and sampling standardisation should be considered more carefully
  if the model is to be applied to field measurements.
