title: A histogram based betting function for conformal martingales
abstract: This paper investigates the use of Conformal Martingales (CM) for providing
  a numerical indication of how likely it is that the exchangeability assumption holds
  on a set of data. Reliable and fast testing of exchangeability is an important challenge
  because many machine learning algorithms rely on this assumption. Therefore a technique
  with only a few parameters to tune, that is able to reject the exchangeability assumption
  with respect to a significance level should be very beneficial for enhancing the
  reliability of such machine learning models. Our approach consists of a CM whose
  betting function is estimated on the previously seen p-values, we compare its computational  efficiency
  and its performance with a kernel betting function and the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test.
  We test our approach on two benchmark data-sets, USPS and Statlog Satellite data.
