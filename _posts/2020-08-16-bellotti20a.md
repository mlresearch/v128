title: Constructing normalized nonconformity measures based on maximizing predictive
  efficiency
abstract: The problem of regression in the inductive conformal prediction framework
  is addressed to provide prediction intervals that are optimized by predictive efficiency.
  A differentiable function is used to approximate the exact optimization problem
  of minimizing predictive inefficiency on a training data set using a conformal predictor
  based on a parametric normalized nonconformity measure. Gradient descent is then
  used to  find a solution. Since the optimization approximates the conformal predictor,
  this method is called surrogate conformal predictor optimization. Experiments are
  reported that show that it results in conformal predictors that provide improved
  predictive efficiency for regression problems on several data sets, whilst remaining
  reliable. It is also shown that the optimal parameter values typically differ for
  different confidence levels. Using house price data, alternative measures of  inefficiency
  are explored to address different application requirements.
