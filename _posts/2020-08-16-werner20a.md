title: Evaluating different approaches to calibrating conformal predictive systems
abstract: Conformal predictive systems (CPSs) provide probability distributions for
  real-valued labels of test examples, rather than point predictions (as output by
  regular regression models) or confidence intervals (as output by conformal regressors).
  The performance of a CPS is dependent on both the underlying model and the way in
  which the quality of its predictions is estimated; a stronger underlying model and
  a better quality estimation can significantly improve the performance. Recent studies
  have shown that conformal regressors that use random forests as the underlying model
  may benefit from using out-of-bag predictions for the calibration, rather than setting
  aside a separate calibration set, allowing for more data to be used for training
  and thereby improving the performance of the underlying model. These studies have
  furthermore shown that the quality of the individual predictions can be effectively
  estimated using the variance of the predictions or by k-nearest-neighbor models
  trained on the prediction errors. It is here investigated whether these methods
  are also effective in the context of split conformal predictive systems. Results
  from a large empirical study are presented, using 33 publicly available datasets.
  The results show that by using either variance or the k-nearest-neighbor method
  for estimating prediction quality, a significant increase in performance, as measured
  by the continuous ranked probability score, can be obtained compared to omitting
  the quality estimation. The results furthermore show that the use of out-of-bag
  examples for calibration is competitive with the most effective way of splitting
  training data into a proper training set and a calibration set, without requiring
  tuning of the calibration set size.
